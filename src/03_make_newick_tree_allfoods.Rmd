# prepare files to make the newick tree-- this is a newick tree for **all** foods reported by FL100 subjects, regardless of whether it came from a recall that passed QC (04a_qc_recalls.Rmd)

required files: 
1. nodes_fn == taxonomy, defined by FNDDS code (not per food, the general rules). Will use Knight lab file.   
2. food_database_fn == contains ASA24 FoodCodes and Food Descriptions   

# make tree

```{r}
source("../lib/make.food.tree.r")

```

```{r}

               food_database_fn = "../data/03_make_newick_tree/fl100_final_foods.txt", 
               output_tree_fn = "../data/03_make_newick_tree/fl100_newick_tree.txt",
