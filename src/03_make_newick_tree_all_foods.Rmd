# prepare files to make the newick tree-- this is a newick tree for **all** foods reported by FL100 subjects, regardless of whether it came from a recall that passed QC (04a_qc_recalls.Rmd)

required files: 
1. nodes_fn == taxonomy, defined by FNDDS code (not per food, the general rules). Will use Knight lab file.   
2. food_database_fn == contains ASA24 FoodCodes and Food Descriptions   

# make tree
