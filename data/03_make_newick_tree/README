A newick tree (raw_newick_tree/) was generated using make.food.tree.r from the list of unique FL100 ASA24 foods (fl100_foods_for_newick.txt). 

make.food.tree.r generated a tree with levels based on the FNDDS FoodCode. Some foods (02_manual_curation) did not follow this coding scheme and needed to be manually inserted into the Newick Tree. 

Notes on adding manual curations to the Newick Tree (manual_newick_tree/): 

The following foods were added: 

92101900 Coffee_latte_W_SOY_MILK >> added following Coffee_latte

32105010	Egg_omelet_or_scrambled_egg_with_ham_or_bacon_and_cheese >> added following Egg_omelet_or_scrambled_egg_with_cheese_W_VEGETABLE_OIL_NFS_INCLUDE_OIL_NFS 

41430310	Protein_diet_powder_with_soy_and_casein >> added following Protein_powder_NFS
41435110	High_protein_bar_candy_like_soy_and_milk_base >> added following Nutrition_bar_or_meal_replacement_bar_NFS

53115600	Cake_poppyseed_without_icing >> taxonomy generated using make.food.tree.r was left as-is (not the same as what I came up with from manual curation, but it’s close enough and I’d prefer to use the automated method as much as possible.)

Note that for 41430310 and 41435110, the node generated using make.food.tree.r was deleted, since the location/taxonomy was generated using the FNDDS foodcode (which put them with legume products).
